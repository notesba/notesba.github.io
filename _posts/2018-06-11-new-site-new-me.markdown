After trying out multiple cloud-based web development platforms, I decided that I needed to find a more sustainable way for me to design my own website. By using Jekyll in conjunction with GitHub, I'm able to generate this site quickly and efficiently using any editor without having to deal with long upload times. Each post is written in Markdown, parsed in Python and generated to HTML. I'll continue to develop styling and structure as necessary, but I'll probably leave this site pretty minimal in terms of the amount of features.

I'd like to use this site for displaying code and lifestyle content. Still need to check up on those Jekyll docs and work out some of the other GitHub logistics, but one thing at a time.

"Is it possible?' repeated Defarge, bitterly. 'Yes, and a beautiful world we live in, when it is possible, and when many other such things are possible, and not only possible, but done - done, see you! -Under that sky there, everyday."
